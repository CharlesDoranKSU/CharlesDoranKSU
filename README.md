Hi, all. My name is Charles Doran, an Information Systems major at Kennesaw State University.

I am starting this school-affiliated GitHub account for use in my IS 3020 Application Development course.

My professional role is Assistant Director at Code Ninjas in Acworth, where we teach kids programming and game design with languages such as JavaScript and C# using game development platforms such as Unity.
